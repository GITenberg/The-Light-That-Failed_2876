description: One of Kipling's most interesting novels, The Light that Failed hovers
  on the edge of sentimentality for most of its pages, never quite slipping. Dick
  Heldar is an artist, who becomes successful through drawings of a war in Sudan for
  one of the London newspapers - this being in the days before photographs filled
  the newspapers. Returning to London, he begins to work as a serious artist, and
  re-encounters his childhood playmate, Maisie, and falls in love with her. Just as
  he begins work on what is to be his masterpiece, he has to seek medical advice for
  a problem with his eyes and is told that he is going blind, incurably, as a result
  of the after affects of a head wound received in the Sudan.
